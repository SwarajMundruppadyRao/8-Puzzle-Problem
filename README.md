*  Run the 8_puzzle_problem.py file using the following command
  ```bash
 python 3 8_puzzle_problem.py
```
*  Enter the Starting and Goal Co-ordinates as per the instructions visible in the terminal window
*  The code will run and generate the path
*  The Node exploration and Optimal Path will be displayed by pygame
*  Once the whole sequence is completed, a video output of the pygame visualisation will be compiled and generated in the folder where you have run the code.
